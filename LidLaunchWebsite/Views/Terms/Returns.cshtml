        <b>6. RETURN POLICY</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>6.1</b> Due to the custom nature of each hat produced, LidLaunch does not offer returns or refunds.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>6.2</b> In the event that the hat you have received is incorrect, a return can be approved at the discretion of LidLaunch. In such case, you are responsible for organising return of the Items to us within 30-day period in order for the Items to be covered under this Policy.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>6.3</b> LidLaunch is not responsible for returning any Items that have been lost in transit.
        <br />
        <br />
